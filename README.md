# NMedia
### Hello there! It's time to introduse my work!

![NMedia](https://github.com/h-0-m-e/NMedia/blob/main/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png)

###### This is NMedia, my project that I am creating as part of my Android developer course at the online university "Netology"

### What does it represents?
###### Mostly it is some kind of social network with posts, users etc.

### More detailed:
###### It is created on Kotlin on the principle of OOP (of course) and MVVM.
###### Current technology stack: 
- ROOM
- MDC
- Uses Git,CI.

### What can we do inside right now?
###### For the most part, this app consists of posts, implementing the CRUD SYSTEM, so of course you can:
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete
##### Also:
- Like
- Share post's text to another app's
- Recieve text from another app to create new post
- Scroll all of your posts
- Edit and Create post at another window (I said it upper)
- If there is a video in the post, then go to YouTube(or another websites) directly from the post, just by tap on preview

### Conclusion
#### NMedia is a constantly developing application in which I invest all my desire and interest on the way to becoming an Android developer!
